# HR-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
**This is my first PowerBI based Data Analysis project. This project showcases the employee attendance data of AtliQ Technologies and builds a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate the working of HR.** <br>
**The goal is to identify the Working preferences of employees (Work From Home / Work From Office) to handle the management of the company, Percentage of overall sick leave to monitor employee wellness.**

*	Created a parameter to select the desired data based on a specific condition.
*	Loaded and Applied the cleaned data into Power BI.

## Exploring and Manipulate Some Data
*	With DAX Query, we can effectively manipulate and analyze the data to provide insights for visualization and identify areas for improvement for HR.
*	Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum, calculate, if, switch, divide, and Date-time functions for exploring some clean data to improve dashboard KPI in PowerBI.
